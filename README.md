All of the Certificate Programs include **CS50X:** *Harvard Universityâ€™s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming*. This course stands as the cornerstone - encompassing essential subjects like computational thinking, data structures, algorithms, and broader aspects of computer science. *Week 1* kicks off the course with **C**, but before that is *Week 0* - which explores **Scratch**, a high-level visual programming language.

Within the broader scope of the programme exists **CS50S:** *An introduction to programming using Scratch* - which is a comprehensive standalone course solely centered around Scratch. My strategy entails beginning with **CS50S** before embarking on the main course. This approach aims to establish a solid programming foundation within a more approachable environment, where I am to develop a robust grasp of programming principles before delving into a more intricate language such as **C**.
